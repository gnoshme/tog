When a module is installed, it's default-settings file is copied from the modules tree to here.  It can then be edited to represent the settings for this install.

DEVS :: For easy testing,  you can create an overrides.rb file here.  It's called after all other settings so can override any default settings in any module.

You can even override the few places like post methods in core settings.
